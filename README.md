# Expression Evaluate

## Whats is evaluate expression?

Basically, an expression evaluation is an algorithm that aims to receive a mathematical expression and return the result of that expression, however, that expression must be passed to the algorithm in the form of a string, that is, the algorithm has a duty to transform past values into integer values to return a correct result.

also note that this algorithm is based on the infix expression, but it can be implemented using the prefix expression or postfix expression.

### Examples of the 3 expressions

#### Infix

`` 5 + 4``

#### prefix

`` + 5 4``

#### postfix

`` 5 4 + ``

the expression infix is more costly for the machine to evaluate, since this notation has a whole rule of precedence of operators, the examples of the implementations passed here use the unfortunate notation, feel free to implement your version using another notation.
