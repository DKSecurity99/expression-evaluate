# Expression Evaluate

## Whats is evaluate expression?

Basically, an expression evaluation is an algorithm that aims to receive a mathematical expression and return the result of that expression, however, that expression must be passed to the algorithm in the form of a string, that is, the algorithm has a duty to transform past values into integer values to return a correct result.

note also that this algorithm is based on infix notation, but it can be implemented using polish notation or reverse polish notation, keep in mind also that the infix notation we use for example:

ˋˋ3 + 3 * 4ˋˋ

it is more expensive for the machine to analyze, as this notation has a whole rule of precedence of operators, but in the end, the examples of the implementations passed here, use the unfortunate notation, feel free to implement your version using another notation.
